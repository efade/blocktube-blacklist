# Block Content Farm Channels on YouTube With BlockTube Extension

This is a channel id based blacklist for use with [BlockTube](https://github.com/amitbl/blocktube) extension. It's a great extension to block unwanted YouTube channels from showing in recommendations, related videos, and search videos. It's available for Chrome and Firefox.

This list contained almost all content farm channels that I know of. I spend an hour searching and adding these channel ids to BlockTube by using context menu. I copy all these ids here so for future use on another machine or in case I have to reinstall my OS, etc. And I thought why not make it public as I'm certain many will benefit from this.

To use it just copy all the channels id from [here](https://github.com/efade/blocktube-blacklist/blob/main/content_farm_channel_id) to BlackTube. There is an input area named "Channel ID" in the extensions options. Paste it there and save.

PS: This blacklist is based purely on my personal tastes so maybe you want to check through it first. If you find any channels that you like in this list, simply delete it before saving.
